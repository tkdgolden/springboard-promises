    <h3>Make a request to the Numbers API (http://numbersapi.com/) to get a fact about your favorite number.</h3>
    <p id="fact1"></p>
    <h3>Figure out how to get data on multiple numbers in a single request. Make that request and when you get the data back, put all of the number facts on the page.</h3>
    <ul id="facts2"></ul>
    <h3>Use the API to get 4 facts on your favorite number. Once you have them all, put them on the page. It's okay if some of the facts are repeats.</h3>
    <ul id="facts3"></ul>
    <h2>Part 2: Deck of Cards</h2>
    <h3>Make a request to the Deck of Cards API to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck.</h3>
    <ul id="card1"></ul>
    <h3>Make a request to the deck of cards API to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Once you have the card, make a request to the same API to get one more card from the same deck. Once you have both cards, console.log the values and suits of both cards.</h3>

    <h3>Build an HTML page that lets you draw cards from a deck. When the page loads, go to the Deck of Cards API to create a new deck, and show a button on the page that will let you draw a card. Every time you click the button, display a new card, until there are no cards left in the deck.</h3>
